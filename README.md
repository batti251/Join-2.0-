# 📋 Join – Kanban Board Web App

Join is a browser-based Kanban board application developed as a **group project** during the Developer Akademie Frontend Course.  
The goal was to collaboratively build a task management tool using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without any frameworks, and a **Firebase backend**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Join allows users to manage tasks visually using a Kanban board approach.  
Tasks can be created, edited, moved between different statuses, and assigned to contacts.  
The project focuses on teamwork, clean JavaScript structure, and backend integration with Firebase.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Collaborate in a team using Git and GitHub
- Plan and structure a larger frontend project
- Work with **Firebase** as a backend (authentication & data storage)
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Build a full application using, without a library
- Manage application state without frameworks

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Application structure  
- **CSS3** – Layout and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Application logic  
- **Firebase** – Backend (database & authentication)  

➡️ No frameworks or libraries used – pure vanilla JavaScript.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

## 🧭 Navigation

The application consists of four main sections:

- **Summary** – Overview of tasks and current status
- **Add Task** – Create new tasks
- **Board** – Kanban board view
- **Contacts** – Manage contacts

---

## ✅ Task Management

### Task Statuses
Each task can be assigned to one of four statuses:

- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Await Feedback**
- **Done**

Tasks can be moved between these states via the board.

## ✨ Features
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to contacts
- Set task priorities and due dates
- Full CRUD functionality

---

## 👥 Contacts

- Create new contacts
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete contacts
- Assign contacts to tasks

---

## 🧪 Guest Login

A guest login is available for testing purposes.  
Guests can explore the application without creating an account.

## 🤖 Planned Feature: AI Task Assistant

As a next step, Join will be extended with an AI-powered assistant.

The goal is to allow stakeholders to submit feature requests and technical tasks via email.
Incoming emails will be automatically analyzed, categorized, prioritized, and converted into tasks on the Kanban board.

This feature is designed to demonstrate a practical use of AI-driven automation with a clear, user-friendly workflow for portfolio and demo purposes.
